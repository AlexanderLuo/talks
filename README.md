Some talks I've given. Mostly on programming.

In this repository:

*   [Algebraic data types](algebraic-data-types/adts.md)

    > People call programming language features "powerful" a lot.
    > I think the word is overused.
    >
    > Algebraic data types are the real thing.

Elsewhere:

*   [Alternate futures: game-playing AI in JavaScript](https://github.com/jorendorff/game-playing/blob/master/talk.md)

    > The shape of the future, then, is this branching shape
    > I like to call the galactic time squid.
    >
    > It's a technical term.
    >
    > Some people call it a "tree".

*   [GC in 50 lines](https://github.com/jorendorff/gc-in-50-lines)

    > As an application programmer, you donâ€™t do memory management for
    > every single object in your program. But somebody has to. The
    > system does it for you. Right?
    >
    > How does that work?

*   [What's known about tutoring](http://jorendorff.github.io/hackday/2013/tutoring/)

    > Like white-hat hackers, expert tutors are taking valuable
    > supervillain skills and using them for good.

*   [Sorting and searching at the library](http://jorendorff.github.io/hackday/2012/library/)

    > When I started at the library, there was this moment, embarrassing
    > now in hindsight, when I thought, hey, I know information
    > systems. I could teach the library a thing or two! But of course,
    > predictably, it turned out the library had something to teach me.
